# Contributing to RegionalEdgeSimPy

Thanks for your interest! This project is designed for teaching and easy experimentation with schedulers.

## How to contribute
1. **Fork** the repo and create a branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-scheduler
   ```
2. Add your changes (e.g., a new scheduler in `scheduler/`).
3. Run the simulator and ensure it generates `results/task_metrics_log.csv`.
4. Commit with a clear message and open a **Pull Request** describing:
   - What changed
   - How to run it
   - (Optional) A small plot from `visualization/`

## Style
- Keep code simple and student-friendly.
- Preserve function signatures used by the simulator.
- Add short comments where students need guidance (e.g., extension points).

## Getting help
- Use the discussion forum: https://resp.afzalbadshah.com
